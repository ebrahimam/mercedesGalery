              Emil Jellinek's entry, into this industry Mercedes is a Spanish
              girl’s name that means loving kindness and beauty. <br />

              father was an Austrian businessman named Emil Jelinek, who lived

              made a trip to Kannstadt to visit the Daimler factory and also to
              order his first Daimler car.

              6-horsepower, was transmitted to the wheels by a strap, but the
              car was delivered in October 1897 with a maximum speed of 24 km/h,
              which was too slow for Yelink. for this reason, <br />
              he asked for an increase in power up to 40 horsepower for the
              other two models that he wanted to buy. two cars were built and

              front of the car, and these two models are among the first
              four-cylinder vehicles in the world.

              finance and noblesse, and his activities as a businessman
              continued to increase and progress. <br />

              wealthy classes of society. in 1899, DMG company by order of Mr.
              Yelink, ten cars were built, and in 1900, the number increased to

              <br /> Mr. Yelink demanded more powerful and faster cars from the
              DMG company. From 1899, he entered the car racing competitions and
              for the first time, he put the name of his 10-year-old daughter
              Mercedes, on the competing car, a name that shines in the car
              industry, In the early days only it was the name of the drivers’
              team, not the name of the car or company.

              agreement with DMG company in return of that, the vehicles of this
              company will be sold and the nickname Yelink will be placed on the

              A symbol that drives the automotive<br/> industry During the period of
              economic inflation after the World War one, it was very difficult
              to sell products, especially luxury products such as cars, and
              this industry faced some serious reactions. In the end, only
              strong companies survive that disaster. It was in this way that
              the two companies of DMG and Benz & Cie took steps in 1924 to
              integrate design and production standards such as sales and
              advertising. During that period, two companies, DMG and Benz &
              Cie, independently produced and supplied their products in two
              separate markets. Two years later in June 1926 two of the oldest
              car manufacturers (DMG and Benz & Cie) combined and founded Benz
              A.G (Daimler Benz A.G). In this regard, a new symbol (Logo) was
              also designed, which consisted of various main details of the
              signs of the two companies (DMG and Benz & Cie), the three-pointed
              star sign belonging to the Daimler Motor Company, and surrounded
              by the name Mercedes Benz, this symbol became global and very
              popular. This trademark has seen minor changes over the past
              several decades, and until now, the name of Mercedes-Benz is
              engraved on the all of the products that manufactured, and it
              indicates quality and safety everywhere and on any type of road on
              all over the world, the name Mercedes-Benz means tradition,
              creativity and the future of the automobile world.
